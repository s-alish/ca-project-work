# Turing Machine Simulator Project Report

## Overview

This report provides an overview of the Turing Machine simulator project, its functionality, implementation details, and any challenges faced during the development process. The project simulates the operations of a Turing Machine, which is a theoretical computational model capable of performing arithmetic operations, recognizing languages, and solving computational problems.

## Objectives

- **To develop a Turing Machine simulator** that can perform binary arithmetic operations like increment and decrement.
- **To demonstrate** the step-by-step process of how a Turing Machine processes input based on its configuration.
- **To validate** the accuracy and reliability of the Turing Machine through unit tests and sample configurations.

## Key Features

1. **Simulation of Binary Arithmetic**:
   - The Turing Machine simulator can handle binary increment and decrement operations.
   - It processes input from a binary tape, updating states and symbols according to transition rules specified in the configuration file.

2. **User-defined Configuration**:
   - The configuration file (`config.json`) defines the tape, states, and transition rules.
   - Transitions are specified with current state, read/write symbols, next state, and movement direction.

3. **Step-by-step Execution**:
   - The simulator logs the tape's state after each transition, providing a detailed view of the Turing Machine’s behavior.
   - It displays the sequence of states, tape content, and direction of head movement as the machine processes the input.

4. **Handling Different Operations**:
   - The simulator supports incrementing and decrementing binary numbers.
   - It can also simulate palindromic checks by modifying the transition rules accordingly.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

1. **`com.example.machine` package**:
   - **TuringMachine**: Manages the tape, head, and state transitions.
   - **TuringMachineBuilder**: Constructs the Turing Machine from a given configuration.
   - **Head, State, Tape, Transition**: Core components representing the tape head, machine states, the tape itself, and state transitions.

2. **`com.example.config` package**:
   - **Configuration**: Contains the main settings for the Turing Machine.
   - **TransitionConfig**: Details each transition in the configuration.

### Configuration File (`config.json`)

A configuration file is used to define the machine’s tape, states, and transitions. For example:
```json
{
  "tape": "1110",
  "states": ["q0", "qCarry", "qAccept"],
  "transitions": [
    {
      "currentState": "q0",
      "readSymbol": "1",
      "writeSymbol": "1",
      "nextState": "q0",
      "direction": "RIGHT"
    },
    {
      "currentState": "q0",
      "readSymbol": "0",
      "writeSymbol": "1",
      "nextState": "qAccept",
      "direction": "RIGHT"
    },
    {
      "currentState": "q0",
      "readSymbol": " ",
      "writeSymbol": "1",
      "nextState": "qAccept",
      "direction": "RIGHT"
    },
    {
      "currentState": "q0",
      "readSymbol": "1",
      "writeSymbol": "0",
      "nextState": "qCarry",
      "direction": "LEFT"
    },
    {
      "currentState": "qCarry",
      "readSymbol": "1",
      "writeSymbol": "0",
      "nextState": "qCarry",
      "direction": "LEFT"
    },
    {
      "currentState": "qCarry",
      "readSymbol": "0",
      "writeSymbol": "1",
      "nextState": "qAccept",
      "direction": "RIGHT"
    },
    {
      "currentState": "qCarry",
      "readSymbol": " ",
      "writeSymbol": "1",
      "nextState": "qAccept",
      "direction": "RIGHT"
    }
  ],
  "initialState": "q0"
}
```

### Methodology

- **Initialization**: The Turing Machine is initialized using the builder class, which reads the configuration file.
- **Execution**: The machine processes the input tape according to the defined transitions until it reaches an accepting state or halts.
- **Visualization**: Outputs the state of the tape after each transition, showing the step-by-step process of computation.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Configuration Parsing**: The primary challenge was parsing and interpreting the configuration file correctly. This was resolved by defining clear parsing logic in the `TuringMachineBuilder`.
- **Machine Halting**: Ensuring the machine halts correctly based on the state transition logic. This required careful design of the `execute` method to handle undefined transitions gracefully.
- **Step-by-step Logging**: Implementing detailed logging of state and tape contents during execution to allow easy debugging and verification.

## Results

Testing the simulator with various configurations (increment, decrement) showed that the machine processes the input correctly(from left to right), updating the tape and moving to the appropriate next state as per transition rules. 

- **Increment Example**:
  ```plaintext
  Initial Tape: 1110
  Executing the Turing Machine...
  State: q0, Tape: 0110
  Final Tape: 0001
  ```

- **Decrement Example**:
  ```plaintext
  Initial Tape: 1110
  Executing the Turing Machine...
  State: qCarry, Tape: 0110
  Final Tape: 0110
  ```

## Conclusion

The Turing Machine simulator is a functional implementation capable of performing basic arithmetic operations and palindromic checks. It effectively demonstrates the theoretical concepts of a Turing Machine, providing an educational tool for understanding computation and formal languages.
